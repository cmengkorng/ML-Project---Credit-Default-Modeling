# ML-Project---Credit-Default-Modeling
By using loan dataset from LC (Lending Club), we are going to develop the prediction model for:
- predict the loan defaulter
- categorize a loan by grade
These models will help LC to better identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. And so can automatically provide loan grade to that application.
